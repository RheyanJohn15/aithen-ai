        "assistant": "Knowledge base versioning allows you to manage different versions of your data and knowledge bases across multiple AI agents. This ensures consistency, enables rollbacks, and supports A/B testing of different knowledge configurations. Each version can be assigned to specific agents, giving you control over which data each agent accesses. What kind of data are you looking to version and manage?"

        "assistant": "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that enhances AI models by retrieving relevant information from your knowledge base before generating responses. This allows the AI to provide more accurate, context-aware answers based on your company's specific data. Currently, Aithen supports RAG-based model training as part of our MVP, with fine-tuning capabilities coming soon. How are you planning to use RAG with your data?"
