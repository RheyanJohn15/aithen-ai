# 🧠 Aithen

**Aithen** is an experimental AI platform built to explore the idea of a **domain-adaptable intelligence** — an AI that can be trained locally, fine-tuned for specific industries, and deployed anywhere without cloud dependencies.

This project starts with the **painting business** domain but is designed to evolve into a **generic, self-hosted AI framework** capable of adapting to any dataset or workflow.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Aithen aims to be:
- 🧩 **Adaptable** — can be trained with any structured dataset  
- ⚙️ **Self-Hosted** — runs locally for full control and privacy  
- 💡 **Extendable** — integrates easily with Laravel, Next.js, and Python  
- 🔄 **Evolving** — continuously improved and open to contributions

---

## 🧱 Architecture

Aithen is built around three core components:

| Layer | Framework | Purpose |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js + Tailwind | Chat interface, dashboards, and visual tools |
| **Backend API** | Laravel | Business logic, data handling, authentication |
| **AI Engine** | Python (FastAPI + Transformers / Ollama) | Model inference, fine-tuning, and training |
